# Overview

Welcome! Ionic is a powerful HTML5 native app development framework that helps you build native-feeling mobile apps all with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Ionic is focused mainly on the look and feel, and UI interaction of your app. That means we aren't a replacement for [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) or your favorite Javascript framework. Instead, Ionic simply fits in well with these projects in order to simplify one big part of your app: the front end. We recommend reading [Where does the Ionic Framework fit in?](/blog/where-does-the-ionic-framework-fit-in/) to get a good understanding of the framework's goals.

**Ionic currently requires AngularJS** in order to work at its full potential. While you can still use the CSS portion of the framework, you'll miss out on powerful UI interactions, gestures, animations, and other things.

We will be releasing Cordova/PhoneGap plugins in the future to expand the capabilities of your apps.

    Additionally, all of our [previous releases](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/releases) can also be found on Github.

## Command Line Utility and Seed Project

We have a node.js utility that can be used to quickly start an Ionic project. We are working to build out the functionality of this tool, but right now you can quickly create a project with our [seed project](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-base) by doing:

```
$ npm install -g ionic
$ ionic start myproject`
```

You can also clone the [seed project](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-base) itself, which gives you everything you need to build Ionic apps with Cordova and AngularJS.

## [What's Included](#whats-included)

Ionic comes with compiled Javascript and CSS for your app, optional Sass files and JS Framework extensions, along with a great [icon pack](http://ionicons.com/).

## [License](#license)

Ionic is an open source framework released under a permissive [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. This means you can use Ionic in your own personal or commercial projects for free. MIT is the same license used by such popular projects as jQuery and Ruby on Rails.

## [About Ionic](#about)

  <p>
    Ionic was built by [@benjsperry](http://twitter.com/benjsperry), [@adamdbradley](http://twitter.com/adamdbradley), and [@maxlynch](http://twitter.com/maxlynch) at [Drifty](http://drifty.com/), an independent bootstrapped software company and makers of such fine products as [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/) and [Jetstrap](http://jetstrap.com/).

    Ionic was built to take HTML5 on mobile into the future. We wanted a mobile framework that not only looked and worked great, but was also powerful enough to build the amazing apps the best developers were creating. HTML5's time has arrived. Ionic is the framework that proves it.
